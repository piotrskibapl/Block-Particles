# Block Particles

This is a fork of [Block Particles](https://github.com/Crazy-Crew/Block-Particles). Its main goal is to allow slowing down particle animations - to achieve that, use `/bp cooldown <id> <ticks>`. The time between particle spawning will be extended by the amount of ticks you provide using this command.
